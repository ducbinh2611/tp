## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### [Proposed] Flashcard

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed mechanisms to manage is facilitated by `FlashcardBank`. The `FlashcardBank` contains a list of `FlashcardSet`. Each `FlashcardSet` contains a list of `Flashcard`.

![Flashcard Class Diagram](diagrams/FlashcardClassDiagram.png)

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Edit Task feature

#### Implementation

The edit mechanism is facilitated by `Schedule`, which contains a `UniqueTaskList` such that each task's information can be modified 
after its creation and addition into the `UniqueTaskList`. It implements this following feature:  

* `Schedule#setTask()` — Replaces an existing task in the `UniqueTaskList` with a new task.

These operations are exposed in the `ScheduleModel` interface as `ScheduleModel#setTask()`.

Given below is the example usage scenario and how the edit task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `Schedule` is initialized with the user's saved Schedule, which is saved in the JSON file `schedule.json` locally.
For example, the user already has 3 tasks in the beginning.

![EditCommand0](images/EditCommand0.png) 

Step 2. The user executes `add task T: CS2100 d: Tutorial 8 homework`, adding a new task with a title "CS2100", the description "Tutorial 8 homework" with the unspecified date into the schedule. This task is assigned the index 4 in the `Schedule`

![EditCommand1](images/EditCommand1.png) 

Step 3. The user now knows what is the due date of the currently added task, and decides to edit the relevant time information of the task by executing the `edit task 4 t: 2020-10-21 10:00`. The `edit task` command calls `ScheduleEditCommand#execute()`
 to generate a new task, containing the updated information, for the fields that is not specified in the `edit task` command, such as `title` or `description` in the example, the new task 
 copies the existing fields of the to-be-replaced task. It is followed by calling `ScheduleModelManager#setTask()` to replace the to-be-replaced task at index 4 with the new edited task.
 
 ![EditCommand2](images/EditCommand2.png) 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `ScheduleEditCommand#execute()` creates a new task sharing some of the overlapped fields with the to-be-replaced task. Then `ScheduleModelManager#setTask()` sets the to-be-replaced task with the newly created task at index 4 of the `Schedule`.  

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit task operation works:

 ![EditTaskSeqDiagram](images/EditTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How edit task executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates the new edited task object to replace the to-be-replaced task object.
  * Pros: Update the Schedule consistently throughout the program so that side-effects, such as there are 2 versions of Schedule, can be avoided.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage as the replaced task object still remains in the memory.

* **Alternative 2:** Mutate the task object itself in the Schedule at the corresponding index.
  * Pros: Will use less memory as there is no new creation of task object.
  * Cons: May result in side-effects such as there are out-of-dated versions of Schedule throughout the program.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_


### \[Proposed\] Quiz with storage of answers feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed quiz with storage of answers mechanism is facilitated by `Quiz` and `QuizModelManager`, which implements the `QuizModel` interface. 
It makes use of an array of answer strings as an attribute, stored within a `Quiz` object as `userAnswers`.
Additionally, it implements the following core operations with `Quiz`, which is called by `QuizModelManager`:

* `QuizModelManager#start(Quiz quiz)` — Starts the quiz by initiating the quiz object in the model, 
iterating through the associated flashcard set and showing the first question in the flashcard set.
The presence of at most one quiz object ensures that at most one quiz running at a time.

* `QuizModelManager#hasStarted()` — Checks if a quiz has started. 
This prevents multiple quizzes from running concurrently.

* `QuizModelManager#tallyScore(boolean isCorrect)` — Tallies the score after each answer is shown, 
depending on user's judgement of correctness.

* `QuizModelManager#getQuestion()` — Obtains the question of the next flashcard in the flashcard set.

* `QuizModelManager#getAnswer()` — Obtains the answer of the next flashcard in the flashcard set.

* `QuizModelManager#stopQuiz()` — Stops the quiz. This method is called at the end of the flashcard set iteration. 

* `QuizModelManager#cancelQuiz()` — Cancels the quiz. 
This method is called when the user cancels the quiz before reaching the end of the flashcard set.

* `QuizModelManager#getQuizRecords(FlashcardSetName name)` — Fetches the quiz score based on the associated flashcard set's name. 
The score includes: 
    * the number of correct answers out of the total score within the flashcard set, and percentage scored.
    * the set of questions, the corresponding correct answers and the answers provided by the user
    * whether each question was answered correctly.

These operations are as exactly written in the `QuizModel` and `Model` interface.

#### Usage Scenario
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the quiz with storage of answers mechanism behaves at each step.

##### Step 1
The user launches the application and starts the quiz for a non-empty, valid flashcard set. 
Assume the flashcard set contains only two flashcards for simplicity.

The `Quiz` will be initialized with the initial quiz state with default values for score, 
and the `currentIndex` pointing to the index of the first flashcard, 
with the current command result being the first question.

![StartQuiz](images/StartQuiz.png)

##### Step 2
The user executes `answer` command to submit their answer to the question. 
The `answer` command calls `Quiz#saveAnswer()`, 
storing their answer into the `userAnswers` array attribute in Quiz 
for the question before moving on to the next question.

![StoreAnswer](images/StoreAnswer.png)

##### Step 3
The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

##### Aspect: How quiz with storage of answers executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** .
